# Design Patterns

This repo holds sample implementation of the 23 Gang of Four Design Patterns using C++ programming language.

Design Patterns are divided into three cathegories according to their purpose:

* __Creational__: concern with the instatiation process, making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented
* __Structural__: concern with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures
* __Behavioral__: concern with algorithms and the assignment of responsabilities between objects

## Design Patterns Outline

The following table outlines the 23 GoF Design Patterns.
